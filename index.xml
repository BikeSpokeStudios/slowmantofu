      <description>Trembling Aspen A series of solo improvisations for classical guitar and upright bass. Recorded in September 2019 and March 2020. Released on February 5th 2021.
Trembling Aspen by Slow Man Tofu Soft Melody Maker &amp;ldquo;Slow Man Tofu’s ​Soft Melody Maker​ is, in its themes and some of its presentation, innately familiar and soothing, it is also conversely, in its myriad idiosyncrasies, uniquely disconcerting. What the world needs now is work which transcends binary emotional posturing; which, antithetical to contemporary algorithmic production, doesn’t rely on the psychic conventions of genre, and which stands, lyrically as well as musically, both stoic and delighted, warm and cryptic, subjective yet rational.</description>

      <description>Trembling Aspen by David Parker In February I released Trembling Aspen, a series of 9 solo improvisations for the classical guitar and upright bass. It was my second release in the midst of a global pandemic, the first was my full-length album Soft Melody Maker in 2020. Back then I cancelled a small tour and had to put other plans, including rehearsing and performing with a band, on hold.
Since then so much has changed.</description>

      <description>Soft Melody Maker by Slow Man Tofu A month ago I released Soft Melody Maker, my second full-length release that I co-produced with Matt Rogalsky. This album was created over the course of 4 years from 2016 to 2020. My life had a unique trajectory during this time. Starting out in Kingston, moving to Montreal for half a year, back to Kingston to perform a circus show for two months, off to Halifax for half a year, then to the Caravan Stage Company for a 9-month tour in the US and Canada, then to a small farm on Howe Island, and finally back to Kingston.</description>

      <description>A new year has begun and I think I&amp;rsquo;m ready to finally sit back and write some thoughts about my journey through the last year and what it has brought me.
The last two years were special because of the 12CAT Arts Collective. I was a member of the collective and helped put on some of the 4 dozen shows we held in the warmer months when it was nice outside.</description>

      <description>Diary Tape by Slow Man Tofu In 2018 I experienced some upheaval that lead to intense emotions. At the same time I was processing recent life events from 2016 and 2017 that had thrown my daily life upside down. I moved several times, traveled and gave up many of my material possessions. 2018 was overwhelming for me, especially early on, but there were moments of light and lucidity.
The idea for this tape came out of some recording sessions with friends.</description>

      <description>In February 2018 I started jamming with artist, musician, creator, farmer and all-around friend Bree Rappaport. Our first performance in May used an overhead projector with illustrated acetates as a visual space in which to perform an improvised set of music with clarinet, upright bass, voice and digital signal processing.
After that we created a set of demo recordings. We used some recorded interviews on tape cassette, recorded new interviews, then manipulated the tape playback and played clarinet, guitar, banjo, percussion and voice overtop.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe how long it&amp;rsquo;s been since sitting down to write something on this site. Life has had some major ups and downs in the last 8 months that are impossible to encapsulate in this short message. Instead of trying to say everything, I&amp;rsquo;ll stick to music news.
I was lucky to go to Audiopollination #60 in Toronto at Array Space. It was the 60th edition of the self-curated improvised music series.</description>

      <description>Sheep on the farm, Howe Island, ON.
And so it begins! In just over a week I&amp;rsquo;m hitting the road to play 10 shows in 11 nights. That&amp;rsquo;s the longest string of concerts I&amp;rsquo;ve ever played. It fills me with joy, trepidation, excitement and nervousness.
Touring as a sound technician with the Caravan Stage Company came to an end 5 weeks ago and my life is still an adjustment to living on land in a house as opposed to a boat at sea.</description>

      <description>Tonight the Caravan Stage Company performs its last show in Vancouver on False Creek. It&amp;rsquo;s been fun being the Sound Engineer on this tour that wraps up at the end of the month. Nine months living on a boat and travelling the seas has been a long time. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to get back to making music more often, and for a Slow Man Tofu tour this autumn!
Today I&amp;rsquo;m releasing details for 9 tour dates scheduled for late November in Ontario and Montréal.</description>

      <description>David Parker and Linsey Wellman - Live at IMOO, Ottawa 2017  I particularly enjoyed Parker&#39;s bass playing, with his imaginative use of arco techniques and muting to create different sounds, and how he combined the bass with pre-recorded loops. Wellman impressively expanded his repertoire with the baritone (sax), retaining his own style and using the different capabilities of that instrument to create beautiful sounds. And playing together they showed considerable empathy and coordination.</description>

      <description>I’m living in Victoria, BC for the next month while I’m on vacation from being the Sound Engineer with the Caravan Stage Company. We’ve been touring internationally since April, and it’s been a thrill to work with them. It’s given me time to write new songs, and lots of memories and experiences to write about. I hope to record these in 2018.
