      <description>Steer The largest-scope Slow Man Tofu album - Steer - was co-produced by myself and Matt Rogalsky of Memory Device (PS I Love You, The Gertrudes). Guest drummers Andy Love and Arden Rogalsky invaluably lent their skills to the recordings. Special thanks to Katie Beth for backing vocals on two of the tracks and to Jared Mackay for some banjo pickin’.
Steer by Slow Man Tofu Magicmouth Magicmouth is a release of 5 lengthy improvised works for guitar, voice, and midi instruments.</description>

      <description>A music video for the improvised guitar jam &amp;lsquo;fragile&amp;rsquo;, featuring footage of the moon shot in Halifax, NS.
 This music video I created for a small side project called &amp;lsquo;Snakes 4 President&amp;rsquo;, released December 2016.
 Here is a music video I made for Ramblings, from the album Steer, released August 2016. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly just some random video clips I had on my camera at the time, applied with some tint filters.</description>

      <description>Slow Man Tofu - “Magicmouth”  Magicmouth is the latest release from David Parker&#39;s multi-tentacled creature called Slow Man Tofu. Where his previous tape, Steer, was anchored in rock and folk songwriting with a occasional forays into freer-form experimentation, Magicmouth abandons all conventions of song structure and instead floats on extended and effected guitar improvisations, layered with synthetic tones and dubby, echoey half-singing. David allows his slow paths to wander uninhibited, resulting in an expansive collection of tracks that moves between drone, doom, noisy free improv, and ambient music.</description>
