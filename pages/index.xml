      <description>Steer The largest-scope Slow Man Tofu album - Steer - was co-produced by myself and Matt Rogalsky of Memory Device (PS I Love You, The Gertrudes). Guest drummers Andy Love and Arden Rogalsky invaluably lent their skills to the recordings. Special thanks to Katie Beth for backing vocals on two of the tracks and to Jared Mackay for some banjo pickinâ€™.
Steer by Slow Man Tofu Magicmouth Magicmouth is a release of 5 lengthy improvised works for guitar, voice, and midi instruments.</description>

      <description>A music video for the improvised guitar jam &amp;lsquo;fragile&amp;rsquo;. Shot in Halifax, NS.
 This music video I created for a small side project called &amp;lsquo;Snakes 4 President&amp;rsquo;, released December 2016.
 Here is a music video I made for Ramblings, from the album Steer, released August 2016. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly just some random video clips I had on my camera at the time, applied with some tint filters.
 For David Blackwood by Slow Man Tofu, performed live at La Passe, Montreal, April 2016.</description>

      <description>David Parker and Linsey Wellman - Live at IMOO, Ottawa 2017  I particularly enjoyed Parker&#39;s bass playing, with his imaginative use of arco techniques and muting to create different sounds, and how he combined the bass with pre-recorded loops. Wellman impressively expanded his repertoire with the baritone (sax), retaining his own style and using the different capabilities of that instrument to create beautiful sounds. And playing together they showed considerable empathy and coordination.</description>
